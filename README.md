# Core Gameplay<br/>
## Audio<br/>
<br/>

## Visual<br/>
The 3D scene has 3D meshes as well as 2D background objects<br/>
## Progression<br/>
Player travels to initiate minigames, collecting data. Player then uploads data to mission control, or at least attempts to. There is an emphasis on loneliness that develops as the player keeps going.<br/>
## Prefabs<br/>
Godot is made almost entirely of prefabs, buttons, player, sprites, etc.<br/>
<br/>

# Scene Flow<br/>

## Main Title<br/>
It's there<br/>
## Credits<br/>
It's on the title, not really a point making a whole new scene for it<br/>
## Gameplay<br/>
There's the 3D overworld scene and 2d minigame scenes (not yet implemented)<br/>
## Menus<br/>
There are 2 menus, access the first by tapping the rover, access the second by tapping "Collect Data"<br/>
## Communication<br/>

All scenes are almost immediately reachable<br/>
## Transitions<br/>
none<br/>
